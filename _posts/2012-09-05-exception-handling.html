<p>I've added exception handling into the latest release (1.4.x).  This allows you to specify exception handling policies as below;</p>
<pre>var workflow = new Workflow&lt;string&gt;();

workflow.Configure()
	.On&lt;Exception&gt;(MyExceptionHandler)
	.On&lt;NotImplementedException&gt;(MyNotIMplementedHandler)
	.When().Do(...)</pre>
<p>The When&lt;T&gt;() method closes the definition of exception handlers and you can then define the workflow as usual.  The T in the when clause should match the type of workflow defined.  In this case, string.</p>
<p>My original attempt at handling errors by catching them and setting the operation's success status to false was a bit of a mistake.  I allowed this behaviour to be over-ridden as I could see problems.</p>
<p>I've decided to break the backward compatibility as this previous exception handling mechanism was implemented under time pressure (work and family related) and this is how I envisioned it working initially.</p>
