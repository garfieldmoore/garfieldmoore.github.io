<div>Tests should exhibit symetric change attributes;  A small code change results in a small change to our tests.  Likewise, a small change to the tests should require a small code change.</div>
<div>By contrast, if we see asymemetric changes it means our tests are brittle and we'll spend more and more time refactoring tests.</div>
<div>One reason for brittle tests is a failure to recognise different levels of testing;</div>
<div>Business</div>
<div>Workflow</div>
<div>Technical Activity</div>
<div>A change in the workflow should not break a business test.  Decoupling tests in this way makes them more amenable to change.</div>
<div>It is usually quite easy to see what level a test is because the clarity of a tests decreases as it moves down the list.</div>
<div>A business test is an acceptance test that documents a feature.  These are written in the domain language and created in collaboration with the customer.  These tests change infrequently and are easily understood.</div>
<div>Workflow tests change more frequently and although often understood by the customer are more technical and often at the component level.  These change less often.</div>
<div>Technical activity tests have the least clarity and rarely understood without technical knowledge.  These also change the most frequently.test</div>
