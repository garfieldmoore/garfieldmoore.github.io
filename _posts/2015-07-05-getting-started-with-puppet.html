<p>I've recently started using <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>.&nbsp; One of the things I first struggled with was creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">hello world application</a>.</p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/quick_start.html">getting started documentation</a> you are pointed to a <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/quick_start_helloworld.html">Puppet hello world</a>.&nbsp; This&nbsp; was promising but turned out to be more complicated than I had hoped as it was configuring a client and a server.</p>
<h2>Puppet Standalone</h2>
<p>The installation guide mentioned <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/install_puppet/pre_install.html#standalone-puppet">Puppet Standalone</a>. This sounded like what I wanted but I couldn’t find any other information about installing in this mode.</p>
<p>This isn’t surprising as the documentation is aimed at enterprise use and this wouldn’t be valuable in that context.</p>
<h2>Install Standalone puppet</h2>
<p>After some trial and error I realised that to install standalone puppet you simply download the puppet agent MSI.</p>
<p>Once installed, we just need to write a script to do something.&nbsp; The simplest thing I could think of is to create a folder and write a file into the new folder.</p>
<h2>Hello World Script</h2>
<p><span style="font-family:cou;">Puppet declares the steps to set up a machine in <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_classes.html">puppet classes</a>.&nbsp; Once I found an example the file type on <a href="http://www.puppetcookbook.com/posts/creating-a-directory.html">Puppet Cookbooks</a> it was pretty simple to create this script;</span></p>
<blockquote><pre /><p>class MyFirstScript{</p><p>    file{'c:\HelloWorld\hellowWorld.txt':&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>        ensure =&gt;file,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>        content =&gt; 'Hello world!',&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>    }</p><p>
</p><p>    file{"c:\HelloWorld":<br />        ensure =&gt;"directory",</p><p>    }</p><p>}</p><p>include MyFirstScript</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Save this as MyFirstScript.pp.&nbsp; pp is the extension used for puppet scripts.</p>
<p>The script creates a file called hellowWorld.txt in the c:\HelloWorld folder and adds some content to the file.</p>
<h2>Running the script</h2>
<p>Now we’re going to check the script is valid and execute the script.</p>
<p>Open a command window and use the puppet command to check the syntax of the script;</p>
<blockquote><pre>puppet parser validate MyFirstScript.pp</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now to run this locally at the command line.</p>
<blockquote><pre>puppet apply MyfirstScript.pp</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You should now be able to&nbsp; navigate to the file to check it’s been created.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>This isn’t particularly useful but it shows how to install and run your first script in puppet.</p>
<p>Puppet labs have some great resources to <a href="https://learn.puppetlabs.com/category/self-paced-training">learn</a> about puppet and there are plenty of <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/?_ga=1.208143442.196027094.1436091548">example modules</a> and <a href="http://www.puppetcookbook.com/">cookbooks</a>.</p>
