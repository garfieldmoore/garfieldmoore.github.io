<p>A common problem I see is broken integration tests because objects can’t be serialised across service boundaries. It’s easy to forget to decorate a class or property with the DataContract attribute.</p>
<p>Catching this during integration tests can lead to large slow running test suites and wasted time troubleshooting, as it is rarely obvious what has the issue is.</p>
<p>One goal of continuous integration is to catch errors as early in the process as possible and it turns out this can be caught during unit tests.</p>
<p>It’s simple to add unit tests to ensure a class or property is decorated with the correct attribute;</p>
<pre>[Test]
public void DataMembersSetAsExpected()
  {
       var type = typeof(BankAccount);
       Assert.That(type.IsDefined(
            typeof(System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute), true));
       CheckForDataMemberAttribute(type, "SortCode");
  }
  private static void CheckForDataMemberAttribute(Type type, string property)
      {
          var idProperty = type.GetProperty(property);
          Assert.That(idProperty.IsDefined(
             typeof (System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute), true));
        }
    }</pre>
<p>The main problem with this implementation is developers need to remember to update the test when a new property is added or removed.</p>
<p>It would be simple to refactor this to check all properties on a class using reflection.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t ideal as it will lead to false negatives as properties that won’t be serialised are still checked.</p>
<p>The approach I’ve adopted is to use the DataContractSerialiser to test if an object can serialised;</p>
<pre>    [Test]
    public void Should_Serialise_across_service_boundary()
    {
        var s = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(BankAccount));
        var account = new BankAccount() { Owner = new Person() };
        s.WriteObject(new MemoryStream(), account);
    }</pre>
<p>This has the advantage that it will only test properties that will be serialised and developers don’t have to remember to change the test when adding or removing properties.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Testing objects can be serialised in integration tests results in slow test suites and fails to catch the defect as early as possible.</p>
<p>One approach to unit testing serialisation is to verify classes have been decorated with the DataContract and DataMember attributes.</p>
<p>However, this leads to false positives when developers forget to refactor tests when adding properties.</p>
<p>The approach I am currently using it to use the DataContractSerialiser class to ensure a class instance can be successfully serialised.</p>
