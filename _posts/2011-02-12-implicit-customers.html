<p>Here's another story pattern I often see;</p>
<p>'<em>As a business</em> I want [goal] so that [value]'</p>
<p>Not identifying the stakeholder introduces a couple of barriers to delivering software.</p>
<p>Arguably the most significant is that you have missed the opportunity to learn something about the business.  Understanding the context  improves our ability to deliver software quickly (<em>and therefore be more cost effective</em>).</p>
<p>Reducing our ignorance and gaining a better understanding of our customers can only improve our effectiveness of delivering software.</p>
