<p>I was able to dramatically improve the performance of HttpClient by removing one line of code. Take the below snippet;</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;"> var httpClientHandler = new HttpClientHandler()
 {
      UseDefaultCredentials = true,
      PreAuthenticate = false,
      <span style="color:#ff0000;">ClientCertificateOptions = ClientCertificateOption.Automatic</span>
 };
 var webclient = new HttpClient(httpClientHandler);</pre>
<p>The offending line of code is highlighted.</p>
<p>This code averaged 20 seconds per 100 requests. Using the default ClientCertificateOption.Manual this improved to 4 seconds.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand why this would be, so I cracked open HttpClient with <a title="JetBrains dotpeek" href="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/." target="_blank">Jetbrains dotpeek</a> to take a closer look.</p>
<p>HttpClient eventually calls it's base class SendAsync method.  This calls SendAsync on the handler and it is here the importance of this property becomes clear.</p>
<p>The handler calls the private method CreateAndPrepareWebRequest().  This in turn calls the innocent sounding SetDefaultOptions(...) method where the below code lurks;</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;"> X509CertificateCollection clientCertificates = UnsafeNclNativeMethods.NativePKI.FindClientCertificates();
 if (clientCertificates.Count &lt;= 0)
    return;
 webRequest.ClientCertificates = clientCertificates;</pre>
<p>It turns out the FindClientCertificates() method enumerates the users certificate store <em>on every request</em>.</p>
<p>I found this amazing and it seems extremely wasteful.</p>
<p>I am still trying to figure out if there is a good reason why the certificate store couldn't be enumerated once and the certificate list stored for future requests.</p>
<p>But that's for another day!</p>
