I thought it would be a bit of fun to pass my code through a tag cloud creator. I thought it might give some insights into the domain language.

I usedÂ [Boomerang](https://github.com/garfieldmoore/Boomerang/) for this experiment.

I merged the projects class files into one on the command line;

	for /r ".\boomerang.host" %f in (*.cs) do type %f >> merged_code.txt

Then when over to [tagCrowd.com](http://www.tagcrowd.com/) and created the image below.

I didn't learn much about my project but it was a bit of fun and maybe I'll do some renaming the next time I'm in the code.
