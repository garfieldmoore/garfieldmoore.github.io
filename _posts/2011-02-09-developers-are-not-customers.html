<p>I've been on a number of projects that used 'Technical' user stories.  One incarnation of the 'technical story' I saw on a recent project was the technical debt story.  It went something like this;</p>
<p>'As a developer, I want to handle exceptional cases, so that the software it resilient'</p>
<p>With a little digging it transpired that the previous iterations stories had been developed without accounting for possible failures due to unavailable resources (networks, databases etc).</p>
<p>The often quoted definition of done is 'The simplest thing that works'.  Dan North elaborated this as '...with a sustainable eco-system...' [of code].</p>
<p>So it seems to me that these developer stories existed because the previous stories had been completed without this sustainable foundation.</p>
<p>As developers, we are being paid to produce software (by our customers).  Therefore, any story that has the developer as the role should be viewed with suspicion.</p>
