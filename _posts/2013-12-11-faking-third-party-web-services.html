<p>I've worked on a number of projects that relied on third party web services or API's.  Most of these had a test service but didn't provide a way to return a predetermined response.</p>
<p>This left two choices when testing our software; call the test service or create a fake service of our own</p>
<h2>Third party test services</h2>
<p>Usually the purpose of a test service is to ensure that your production systems will work with their production systems.  So it is used for testing the integration of two systems.</p>
<p>This usually means the only difference is the data is not real or is a sub-set of the live data.  Using it still requires calls across service boundaries (HTTP), expensive computation and storage (like databases).</p>
<p>This creates a number of issues when executing an automated test suite for your software;</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls across services boundaries are expensive, resulting in slow tests and slow feedback</li>
<li>Tests will be brittle because the data can change, leading to different results over time</li>
<li>You may not have access even to the test service in the environment you are running your tests</li>
</ul>
<h2>Faking services</h2>
<p>The solution is invariably to create a fake service that can be configured to return a specific response.</p>
<p>I've done this a few times and without exception the solution has become a maintenance burden. Some  of the problems I've experienced are below;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fake is not re-usable across projects</li>
<li>Duplication of fakes across teams</li>
<li>Different fakes for different third party services</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to a lot of duplication of effort and lost time.</p>
<h2>Proxy servers</h2>
<p>After realising this could be solved with a proxy server I created <a href="https://github.com/garfieldmoore/Boomerang">Boomerang</a> to make this easier.  This enables developers to set predetermined responses for HTTP requests.</p>
<p>For example, I can specify a json object should be returned from a GET for a specific relative address;</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;"><code>var dictionary = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;() { { "content-type", "application/json" } };
Boomerang.Server(5100).Get("/api/products").Returns(products.SerialiseToJsonString(), 200, dictionary);
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a proxy server on port 5100 and specifies the response to a HTTP GET request to the relative uri /api/products should be a list of Products formatted as json.</p>
<p>I created an extension method to help with the json serialisation;</p>
<pre style="padding-left:30px;"><code>public static string SerialiseToJsonString(this object target)
        {
            string str;

            var dataContractJsonSerializer = new DataContractJsonSerializer(target.GetType());

            using (var mem = new MemoryStream())
            {
                dataContractJsonSerializer.WriteObject(mem, target);
                mem.Flush();
                mem.Position = 0;
                str = Encoding.Default.GetString(mem.ToArray());
                Console.WriteLine(str);
            }

            return str;
        }
</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>GET, POST, PUT and delete are supported and the base address is ignored.  If <a href="https://github.com/garfieldmoore/Boomerang">Boomerang</a> receives a request it hasn't got a response for it will return an error response.</p>
<p>I hope this makes testing with third party services a bit easier!</p>
