<p>Accessing gitub can be difficult at work;  ssh tunneling is often blocked by firewalls and proxies make it difficult to use http.</p>
<p>The solution is to set the http_proxy environment variable;</p>
<p>export http_proxy=[PROXY_SETTING]</p>
<p>You can now clone a public git repository over http.</p>
<p>However, this is only half the solution as private repositories use https so this setting doesn't work.</p>
<p>The solution is the similar https_proxy environment variable.  Set this with the below command;</p>
<p>export https_proxy=[PROXY_SETTING]</p>
<p>You can now clone public and private repositories with http and https through your companies proxy.</p>
