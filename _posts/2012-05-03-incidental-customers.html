<p>Consider the following story;</p>
<p><em>As a web master, I want a captcha so that we reduce spam</em></p>
<p>This looks like a reasonable story.  However, I think there is a problem with this story - the web master role is incidental.</p>
<p>What I mean is the web master role is incidental to the implementation technology.  If we changed the technology we implemented our solution in the role of web master would be replaced.</p>
<p>However, the requirement to reduce spam by some sort of manual input (captcha) would remain.</p>
<p>The real customer in this example could be the marketing department or customer service who don't want to waste time on customers that aren't real.</p>
