I play chess in the kent and London leagues for my local chess club - Charlton Chess Club.  This is a small club with some really good players and I have improved enormously since I joined in 2014.

So, I thought it would be fun to share some of my more recent games.

Here is one of my online games playing an opponent rated 1769.
