<p>I started programming back in the early 80's using Z80, &amp; 6502 assembler. I now specialise in continuous deployment, software architecture, and agile development practises.</p>
<p>When not programming I can be found in South East London with my partner, two lovely daughters and our assortment of cats, snakes and spiders</p>
