I'm a programmer and consultant working in London.

I started programming back in the early 1980's when I was 12.  Myself and a friend taught ourselves 6502 assembler. We went on to learn Z80 and 68000 assembler.

I wrote games, utilities, experimented with basic AI and dreamt of a day when games might be photo realistic.  Now they are I play games from the 1980's on my Retro Pie.

When I left school I found myself working in a small, family run engineering workshop.

The first commercial software I wrote was to automate the arduous calculations required to make air-conditioning for this company. This reduced making complicated pieces of duct-work from 1 day to a couple of hours.

I've gone on to build technology for large and small companies as well as working in a number of start-ups.

I now specialise in software architecture, devops and agile development practices.
