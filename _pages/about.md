I'm a programmer and consultant working in London.

I started programming back in the early 1980's when I was 12.  I learnt  programming by teaching myself Z80, 6502 & 68000 assembler.

I wrote games, utilities, experimented with basic AI and dreamt of a day when games might be photo realistic.  Now they are I play games from the 1980's on my Retro Pie.

When I left school I found myself working in a small, family run  engineering workshop.

The first commercial software I wrote was to automate the complex calculations required to make air-conditioning duct-work for this company. This reduced making duct-work from 1 day to a couple of hours.

I've gone on to build technology in large and small companies.

I now specialise in programming, software architecture, and agile development practises.
