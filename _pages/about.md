I'm a software designer, trainer and consultant working in London.  

I started programming back in the early 1980's when I was 12.  Myself and a friend taught ourselves [6502 assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502). We went on to learn [Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) and [68000 assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000).

I wrote games, experimented with basic AI and dreamt of a day when games might be photo realistic.  Now they are I play games from the 1980's on my [Retro Pie](https://retropie.org.uk/).

When I left school I found myself working in a small, family run engineering workshop.  

It was here I wrote my first commercial software to automate the calculations required to make duct-work. This reduced the time and effort making [transformers](https://sheetmetalworld.com/sheet-metal-news/fabrication-tutorials/22-sheet-metal-tutorials/5962-how-to-develop-a-square-to-round) from 4 hours to 90 minutes.

I've gone on to help build teams and technology for large and small organisations as well as working in various stage start-ups.

I now specialise in software architecture, devops and agile development practices.
