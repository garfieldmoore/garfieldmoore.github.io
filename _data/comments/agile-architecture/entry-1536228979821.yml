message: "Nice article. I tend to prefer the option of having technical work in the backlog. If you cannot clearly articulate the value and size to the Product Owner, so the work is prioritised, then it should not be done.\r\n\r\nIt is okay to incur tech debt as long the impact can be measured and is acceptable. When it becomes to painful or hurts business agility, then it can be paid down as a priority. This being said, I always advocate the good citizen behaviour of trying to continually improve code and leave it in a better palce using continual refactoring.  This can help ensure the tech debt levels do not spiral.\r\n\r\nAnother tip i really like from Gregor Hophes book- 37 things one architects knows - is to avoid making decisions that are hard to reverse.\r\n\r\nIn some large teams I have been on have a solution architect work across multiple teams and offer support and guidance. They will be brought in to assist with making difficult decisions that could have wider organisational or long lived implecations.\r\n\r\nArcitecture and non functioal requirements as part of release planning or starter tasks on an initial backlog creation is sound advice.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing!"
