## Introduction
Simulation theory has been getting a lot of attention lately.  In this article I review what simulation theory is, why it's important and what the consequences of the theory are.

First let's look at what the theory is;

## Overview
Simulaiton theory is the argument that we may be living in a simulation. The argument is based on the idea that if technology continues at any pace at all, we will soon have the ability to create virtual worlds that are indistinguishable from reality.

Think this is far fetched?  Think about it - 40 years ago we were playing pong on an oscilioscope. Today our games are photo-realistic, and we already have more immersive virtual reality technology.

Just imagine where games will be in another 10, 20, or 40 years time.  

Many people think that it's inevitable that technology will reach the point of being able to create a simulation indistinguishable from reality.

The rub: The consequence of this line of reasoning is that our ancestors may have reached this point and we are living in one of their simulations.

Let's now look at the formal argument as proposed by [Nick Bostrum];

## The Simulation Theory

Nick Bostrum proposed that at least one of the below statements must be true;

1. the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage

2. Any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or
variations thereof)

3. We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation. It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that
we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor‐simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation

When reading this for the first time it seems there is an option missing. Surely, there is the possibility that we aren't living in a simulation?

This is covered in the final point -

'It follows that the belief there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor‐simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation'

So, Nick Bostrum's argument is that if we will one day reach the point of running simulations we must already be in one.  

This doesn't sound coherent but we will come to back to this later!

First let's look at the simpler scenario's (1) and (2).

### We are going to be extinct
This is straightforward - One possible scenario is that we will become extinct before reaching a level of technology where we are able to run simulations.

So, if we reach the posthuman stage we will have the technology to run experiments.

Given our previous discussion on technological progress this seems reasonable.  We will either reach the state of posthuman (with all the technological magic this implies) or become extinct before we reach this point.

### Posthumans won't run experiments
This possibility is that posthumans might choose not to run simulations even though they can.

If we can run simulations why wouldn't we?

There may be any number of reasons for this;

Firstly, on reaching the posthuman stage we may not want to run experiments of our ancestral history. Our motivations and interests might change.

Secondly, becoming aware of moral or ethical issues we may impose strict sanctions on running simulations (legally or socially imposed).

These are not the only possibilities. Showing the above two are false does not prove this scenario is false.

There may be many other reasons why we would choose to not run experiments.

### We are living in a simulation
So, this is the most interesting scenario for our discussion.

why can we not be in base reality??

Explain...

## A brief history of false realities
The idea that reality may not be what we think it is has a long history.

Back in [year] Descartes proposed his evil genius argument. Descartes proposed that he could not trust anything he thought was fact because the world may be under the control of an omnipotent evil genius.

This genius may have set the world up to fool Descartes and there was nothing he could do about it.  Everything may seem real but in fact wasn't.

This is an extension of the classical line question 'how do I know what I think is real is actually real'.

## Odds and ends


## Conclusion
Which of these is true?

Well, it's not the purpose of the simuation argument to show which one is true - only to show that one of these must be true.

We can hope (1) isn't true as it doesn't paint a positive picture for our future.

We can hope that we will reach the posthuman stage and not run simulations, or we are in a simulation.

However, what we cannot know is which one of these is true or if any of them are false.

One of them is true, we just don't know which one.
