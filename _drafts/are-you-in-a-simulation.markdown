## Introduction
Simulation theory has been getting a lot of attention lately.  In this article I review what simulation theory is, why it's important and what the consequences of the theory are.  

First let's look at what the theory is;

## Overview
Simulation theory is the argument that we may be living in a simulation. The argument is based on the idea that if technology continues to improve at any pace at all, we will eventually have the ability to create virtual worlds that are indistinguishable from reality.

Think this is far fetched?  Think about it - 40 years ago we were playing pong on an oscilioscope. Today our games are photo-realistic, and we already have more immersive virtual reality technology.  

Just imagine the quality of a game in ten or twenty, let along forty years time.

Many people think that it's inevitable technology will reach the point of being able to create a simulation indistinguishable from reality.  

The consequence of this line of reasoning is that our ancestors may have reached this point already and we are living in one of their simulations.

So thats the essence of the simulation aregument.  Let's now look at the formal argument as proposed by [Nick Bostrum](https://nickbostrom.com/).

## The Simulation Theory
Nick Bostrum proposed that at least one of the below statements must be true;

1. the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage

2. Any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or
variations thereof)

3. We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation. It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that
we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor‐simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation

When reading this for the first time it seems there is a missing option.

Surely, there is the possibility that we aren't living in a simulation - that we are living in base reality?

This is covered in the final point -

'It follows that the belief there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor‐simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation'

So, Nick Bostrum's argument is that if we will one day reach the point of running simulations we must already be in one.  

This doesn't seem obvious at first - we will come to back to this later!

First let's look at the simpler scenario's (1) and (2).

### We are going to be extinct
This is straightforward - One possible scenario is that we will become extinct before reaching a level of technology where we are able to run simulations.

Perhaps, we will kill ourselves with bio-chemical weapons or find some other interesting way to die. Perhaps some natural disaster will befall us.

So, we will either become extinct or we will reach the posthuman stage and have the technology to run simulations.

Given our previous discussion on technological progress this seems reasonable.  We will either reach the posthuman stage (with all the technological magic this implies) or become extinct before we reach this point.

This doesn't seem a very optimistic option, so I for one hope this isn't true.

### 2. Posthumans won't run experiments
Another possibility is that posthumans might choose not to run simulations even though they can.  If we can run simulations why wouldn't we?

There may be any number of reasons for this;

Firstly, on reaching the posthuman stage we may not want to run simulations simply because our motivations and interests have change.

Or perhaps, becoming aware of moral or ethical issues we may impose strict sanctions on running simulations (perhaps legally imposed).

These are not the only possibilities. Showing the above two are false does not prove this scenario is false.

There may be many other reasons why we would choose to not run experiments.

### 3. We are living in a simulation
Now, this is the most interesting scenario for our discussion.

Let's look at the original scenario again;

 'We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation. It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that
we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor‐simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation'

This is a bit wordy so let's split this up into two;

* 3.0 We are living in a simulation.

* 3.1 The above statement (3.1) is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation.

Why is 3.1 true? Why does it follow that the belief that we are in a simulation is false unless we are already living in a simulation?

To answer this let's take a detour back to the 1970's game show [let's make a deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal).

#### The Monty Hall problem
In this game show there are 3 doors.

Behind one door is a great prize but behind the other doors there is a booby prize.

Let's say you pick a door.  The host then opens another door to show you a booby prize and asks you if you want to change your choice to the third door - the one that you didn't choose.

What should you do?

Well initially when there were three doors you had a 33% chance of picking the amazing prize.

In other words, you had a 66% of being wrong.

So it follows you most likely didn't pick the door with the amazing prize.

Therefore, you should swap for the other door, because by swapping you have a 66% chance of picking the door with the amazing prize but only 33% chance by staying with your original choice.

#### Simulations and probability
So the idea is similiar in that it is based on probability;

There are more possible simulations than our original base reality (just the one).

So, if you assumed you were in the original base reality you would be wrong most of the time.

Whereas, if you assumed you were in a simulation you would be right most of the time.

We can describe this as the below premises and conclusion;

1. There is a significant chance that we may one day become posthumans who run ancestor simulations.
2. It is far more probable we are one of the many simulations than the original base reality.
3. Therefore, if (1) is true then most likely we are already living in a simulation.

So now we understand the simulation argument.

Before we finish I'd like to look at one similiar theory from the past.

## The evil genius
The idea that reality may not be what we think it is has a long history.

Back in 1641 [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes) proposed his [evil genius argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon).

Descartes proposed that he could not trust anything he thought was fact because the world may be an illusion created by an omnipotent evil genius.

This genius may have set the world up to fool Descartes and there was nothing he could do about it.  Everything that he took as fact was false.

This is an extension of the classic question 'how do I know what I perceive as real is actually real?'.

This is known as a [sceptical hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism#Skeptical_hypotheses) - it is an argument that if true, would yield all our beliefs about reality invalid.

This seems similiar to the simulation argument.  However, there is an important difference;

It's been debated that the simulation argument is not a sceptical argument - the argument is that we may be in a simulation of reality.

Therefore, our beliefs about reality hold true even if we are in a simulation.

However, it doesn't seem impossible to recast Descartes argument in such a way that it too is not a sceptical argument.

Neither, does it seem impossible to recast the simulation argument in a way that makes it a sceptical argument. Nor would this make it any less likely.

## Conclusion
So, which of these are true?

Well, it's wasn't Nick Bostrums purpose to show which one is true - only to show that one of these must be true.

One of them is true, we just don't know which one.

What we can deduce is that if (1) and (2) aren't true, and that we will reach the point of running simulations then we most likely already are in a simulation.

If we are in a simulation there may be some interesting consequences for ethics, morality and physics among others but it seems that all three are equally likely to be true.

One question that occurred to me while writing this is if posthumans run simulations what are the consequences for the 'laws of physics'?

For instance, surely if posthumans run simulatons they would speed the simulation up?
