One of the problems I constantly see in the teams I help is long cycle times and disagreement about what was in or out of scope for a piece of work.

Some issues I often see are;

* Stories taking a long time to finish
* Unexpected delays or extra work required to finish these stories
* Costly replanning of stories that cause further delays
* Confusion between team members and upstream workers
* Lengthy meetings and hand-offs between roles (for example, developers and test)

I am sure there are an infinite number of ways a team can come to this situation.  However, I think there are one or two practises that most commonly cause most of the issues above - or at least, there are one or two pracises that mitigate a large set of the above problemse.  

Therefore, I am going to constrain myself to tackling what I think is one of the most common issues I see; the scope of the story.

If there was one practise I would advocate to a team that is struggling with commitments it would be to create small stories.  Slicing stories into bite size pieces of functionality has a number of advantages.  Not all of these advantages are intuitive.

In this article I will reflect on some of the reasons why some teams don't split stories into small units of work, how this causes some of these problems. I will then go on to discuss how small user stories can be used to reduce these issues.

First, let's let's remind ourselves why agile engineering uses user stories;

One of the problems with the waterfall process of lengthy requirements gathering, design, development and testing is that checking the software only happens at the end of the project.  A significant time has elapsed and the customers requirements will have changed (or they might not have known what they wanted in the first place)

In  contrast Agile teams are more focused on delivering working software to customers.  To this end there is much more focus on the interaction between the customers and the engineering teams.  Requirements take the form of user stories that are 'reminders to have a conversation' [probably dan north].

The below format is well known;
Given a [role] I want [feature] so that [business value]

How large should a story be.  A story must be somethig that is valueable to your customer independantly. One example given by Mike Cohn is that a report has a header, body and footer.  Therefore, this can be split into no more than 3 stories.

I think this is where teams make the first mistake. Value is hugely subjective.


One of the consequences of this change of focus from lots of up front analysis to delivery has a


Agile software development teams split stories into small units.  This enables the customers and development team to try out the software and provide feedback to the development teams.

customers can provide feedback early
Customers and developers have more opportunities to learn
Changes are cheaper earlier in the process
Estimating is more accurate - hidden complexity
Delivering small stories leads to more predictable projects


* Conclusion
Splitting requirements into small requirements not only provides value to your
customers sooner but also makes the delivery more predictable.

This leads to happier customers as they get to try out the product sooner in the, are able to provide feedback to the development team and are better able to predict when the project will be delivered.

However, it's not as simple as breaking the work into the smallest number of pieces.  Software engineering does not contain homogeneous work and there are often transaction costs associated with each story.

Teams need to break stories into the smallest piece of work that provides value to your customers.
