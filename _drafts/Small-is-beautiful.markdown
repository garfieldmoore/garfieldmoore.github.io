When I am working with teams to create a requirements backlog I
always try to break the requirements into bite size pieces.

There are a number of advantages to this that I'll go into detail in this blog.

One of the problems with the waterfall process of requirements gathering, design, development and testing is that checking the software only happens at the end of the project.  A significant time has elapsed and the customers requirements will have changed (or they might not have known what they wanted in the first place)

Agile software development teams split stories into small units.  This enables the customers and development team to try out the software and provide feedback to the development teams.

customers can provide feedback early
Customers and developers have more opportunities to learn
Changes are cheaper earlier in the process
Estimating is more accurate - hidden complexity
Delivering small stories leads to more predictable projects


* Conclusion
Splitting requirements into small requirements not only provides value to your
customers sooner but also makes the delivery more predictable.

This leads to happier customers as they get to try out the product sooner in the, are able to provide feedback to the development team and are better able to predict when the project will be delivered.

However, it's not as simple as breaking the work into the smallest number of pieces.  Software engineering does not contain homogeneous work and there are often transaction costs associated with each story.

Teams need to break stories into the smallest piece of work that provides value to your customers.
